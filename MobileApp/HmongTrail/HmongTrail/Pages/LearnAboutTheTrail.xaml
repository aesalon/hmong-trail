    <Label Text="Following Wold War II and after the French lost power and left Vietnam in 1954, there was a power struggle for control of Vietnam. The fight was against the Communist Soviet Union and China with the Democratic United States on the other side.
Due to the terrain of Vietnam being a jungle, the US had many difficulties preventing Communist Soviet and Chinese forces from sending weapons to arm the Communist North Vietnamese against the Democratic South Vietnamese. The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) turned to the Hmong people for help during the Vietnam War against communist insurgents."
